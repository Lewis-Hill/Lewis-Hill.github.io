The Reincarnation mechanic makes the Player think in creative ways to get their health to 0. Procedural level generation means you never get the same layout twice. </p>

								<p>After picking up an item using the Interact Interface, the function AddToInventory is called on the Player's Inventory Component. The Data Structure attached to the Item tells the function all the attributes the slot should have. If the Item already exists in the Player's Inventory, it checks to see if the picked up item can be added to an existing slot. If not, a new slot is created for that item.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Camera</h3>
								<p>The ToggleInventory function deals with any situation where the Inventory is opened or closed, and creates or removes the Inventory UI as appropriate. This covers situations where a chest is interacted with and both Player and Chest inventories are opened, pressing Tab to open the Player Inventory, or pressingthe "X" button to close any Inventory. There is a bool called "IsTransferInventory" to tell the function if there is another inventory to close other than the Player's.</p>

								<p>When the mouse is held on a slot, that slot creates a DragDrop operation and the Drag UI icon which takes the attributes of the item. The original slot is wiped to make the dragging more convincing. The DragDrop operation also takes the Structure attributes from the specific slot as an Input variable, so that it knows how to transfer the item when it is dropped on</p>

								<p>I made creating new objects such as Chests and NPCs, with their own Inventory, as simple as creating a child class of the "Container" Blueprint, which comes with its own Inventory Component. From there, you just give it a new static mesh, choose the name of the Container and decide how many slots the Inventory will have.</p>
								<p>Once set in the level, you can easily add the items that will start off in the Containers. You can also choose whether it will have a Quest for the Player (For NPCs), and set the Item the Player will need to donate for the Quest, and how many.</p>
